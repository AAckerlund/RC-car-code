#For Users
  * Note: To control this vehicle an xbox controller is required.
There are 4 buttons on an xbox controller that act as the controls for this vehicle. They are the bumpers and triggers.

  * The bumpers are located at the top of the controller facing away from a person holding the controller. *They are typically marked with a small RB and LB for Right Bumpoer and Left Bumper respectively*

  * The triggers and simillarly located on the side facing away from a person holding the controller. *They are located right below the bumpers and are typically marked with a LT and RT for Left Trigger and Right Trigger respectively.*

##The controls
The left bumper and trigger control the wheels on the left side of the car. Similarly the right bumper and trigger control the right wheels.

The bumpers define what direction their respective wheels will turn. When pressed the wheels are put in reverse, when not pressed they will move forward.
  * Pressing the right bumper will cause the wheels ont he right side to spin backwards but will not effect the left wheels. This is the same for the left bumper and wheels.

The triggers define how fast the wheels turn. While not pressed the wheels will not spin. When fully pressed the wheels will turn as fast as they can.
  * Pressing the right trigger will cause the right wheels to turn and will not affect the speed of the left wheels. This is the same for the left trigger and wheels.

#For Developers
To download this code either download it as a zip file or clone it into your prefered directory.
There are 2 files that you can edit. *Controller.py* and *ArduinoLight.ino*
  * Note: To compile the .ino file you will need the Arduino IDE found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

##To run the code
1. make sure you have:
	1. The vehicle
	2. An xbox controller
	3. A computer
2. Attach the xbox controller to the computer
3. Make sure the car is turned on and ready to go
4. With the arduino code running on the car, run the .py file
	  * If the controller and car fail to connect make sure you have bluetooth enabled and that you are connected to the bluetooth chip on the car.
5. Enjoy.
